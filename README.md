<h1>Hello there! I'm [redacted], but if you know me it's fairly obvious who I am.</h1>
<p>Fluent in Javascript(+PJS), Python, (the basics of)HTML, a bit of Java, barely any C++ or C#, hopefully Assembly in the future, and I have no idea what Rust is.</p>
<p>I have no intentions to use this account professionally. <i>I'm not even that good a programmer...</i> <br>But anyways, feel free to snoop around my Github.</p>
